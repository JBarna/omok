# omok
Based on a mini-game played in a larger MMORPG named "MapleStory". I used to play this little puzzle game against other people all the time and I got quite competitive at it. I wanted to play the game without having to install and make a character in MapleStory, so I created this web app to simulate the smaller game, Onok.

# Technology
Node.js, socket.io, MongoDB, jQuery.
The shining star of this project is the use of socket.io. Socket.io is a powerful open source library that allows for multi-client communication in real time with TCP sockets.

If you open two windows and join the same room, you can play the game together.

# Issues
No issues, I just got bored of making it. I'm sure one day I'll go back to it.
